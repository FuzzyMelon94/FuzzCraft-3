# FuzzCraft 3

A custom modpack created for me and my friends, with some mods to keep everyone interested!

## Themes for the pack

- Automation
- Magic
- Technology

## Setting up development

Using `packwiz` to get this set up and versioned nicely.

1. Clone this repo
2. Make sure `packwiz` is [installed](https://packwiz.infra.link/installation/) and running properly
3. Use `packwiz serve` to get a local "downloadable" for ATLauncher ([command on instance](https://packwiz.infra.link/tutorials/installing/packwiz-installer/))
   - Note: can use `-s server` to download "non-client" mods
4. Use `packwiz [mr|cf] add [URL|name]` to install mods
   - `mr` sources from Modrinth
   - `cf` sources from CurseForge
   - `URL` takes a direct link to the mod page
   - `name` searches the site for the mod name - returns options if required
